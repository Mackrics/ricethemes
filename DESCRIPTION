Description: The term R.I.C.E stands for Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancements and was used in car tuning communities. Basically, it is a cosmetic upgrade, which have no implications on performance. It is also a term widely used in desktop customization. This ggplot theme is inspired by the desktop customization enthusiasts and implements two popular themes from the desktop ricing community: Catppuccin and Nord Although they will make your plots look a little bit nicer, I can not guarantee a performance improvement.
